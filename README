##PYTHON OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
*Classes

A class is a collection of objects.
A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.
It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.

#*Objects#

The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it

*Encapsulation

It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.

*Abstraction

It hides unnecessary code details from the user.
Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.

*Polymorphism

Simply means having many forms.
It shows how subclasses can override methods defined in their parent class to provide specific
behavior while still inheriting other methods from the parent class.

*Inheritance

Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class
